This is my web portfolio from high school.

## Maturita (unavailable for now):  


Maturita project I made for my class teacher.
She wanted a site for her camp that she organized during the summer vacation.

I tried to create my own system for uploading files, creating posts and galleries that was supposed to be easy to use for her. Unfortunately she never did and after few months I deleted the whole website since she did not need it anymore.



## [RP](https://zylacx.github.io/web_portfolio/rp/):  


One of the first websites that I made on my own.
I created it for an assignment for the annual project that I made during the whole school year

For some reason I always wanted to make a site that will give you random "facts". I made 2 mock ups ([single page with button](https://zylacx.github.io/web_portfolio/rp/Web.jpg) and [one that's similar to the website](https://zylacx.github.io/web_portfolio/rp/image/Web2.jpg))for my graphic lectures and later decided it would make a great project as a website.
I didn't fact check any content back then so don't trust everything you see :).

Originally I planned on adding much more stuff to the site but school got in the way and I left it in the state I submitted it in.
