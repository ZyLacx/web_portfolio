This is my web portfolio from high school.

Maturita (unavailable for now):
Maturita project I made for my class teacher.
She wanted a site for her camp that she organized during the summer vacation.

I tried to create my own system for uploading files, creating posts and galleries that was supposed to be easy to use for her. Unfortunately she never did and after few months I deleted the whole website since she did not need it anymore.


RP:
One of the first websites that I made on my own.
I created it for an assignment for the annual project that I made during the whole school year

When I was younger I was fascinated that there are so many things in the world and my knowledge is extremely tiny compared to all the "facts" that are out there.

Originally I planned on adding much more stuff to the site but school got in the way and I left it in the state I submitted it in.
