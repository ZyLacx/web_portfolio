This is my Maturita project I made for my class teacher.
She wanted a site for her camp that she organized during the summer vacation.

Most of the functionality was removed so I can use it as a preview.
The code is a mess and rewriting most functions from MySQL to SQLite really did not help but I lost the original database so I needed to create a new one.

Looking at it now I can tell that I got better at code decomposition and don't repeat myself as much,
